Welcome to Antares Launcher's documentation!
==================================================

Antares Launcher (AL) allows users to seamlessly send and submit a list of Antares simulations on a remote Linux machine.

Antares Launcher can be viewed as a plugin for Antares, it creates a bridge between your local computer and a remote server/machine.
It is a simple tool that allows you to export computations to a distant slurm server.

A couple of computation options are described in "User Guide" section.

This diagram describes the behavior of the module between your local computer and the distant machine.
